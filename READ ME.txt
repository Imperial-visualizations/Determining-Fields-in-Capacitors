Parrallel Plate Capacitor:

The number field lines created are determining by the inputs from the silders,
whilst the shape of the field lines are determined by the switches.

The field lines are constructed from a line and an arrowhead, thus consitute two traces per field line.
As the plotly animate function requires a constant number of traces in the plot, a number of empty traces are created and
then filled depending on the conditions of the visulisation.

To do:

1. Check that the fields are correct.
2. Make the visulisation faster, currently the large number of traces makes it slow
3. Add visulisation with continous field lines/field line density
